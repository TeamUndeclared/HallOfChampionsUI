# hallOfChampions

It seems that a lot of programs created by former students of Code Fellow may fall through the cracks over time, even though they're clearly some of the coolest ideas ever.

Wouldn't it be nice to have a place for students to showcase and document their favorite projects. Wouldn't it be nice to have a place for Code Fellows to showcase the high quality work their students create.

We'd like to make that showcase and have a living repository of projects, screenshots, authors and links. That's our MVP! The stretch goal would be allowing ACL-based auth to create admins and curators for projects by class, tags (technologies) and such.
